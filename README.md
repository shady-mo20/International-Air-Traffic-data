# International-Air-Traffic-data
I conducted an in-depth analysis of international air traffic data using Python, leveraging various data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning techniques. The project involved cleaning and preprocessing a substantial dataset of international departure reports obtained from Kaggle. I utilized libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn to perform a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

In the initial stages, I handled data cleaning tasks by addressing missing values, converting data types, and creating new relevant features. Utilizing techniques like Label Encoding, I transformed categorical variables into a suitable format for analysis. Subsequently, I employed data visualization tools to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics, trends, and relationships. This included creating various bar plots, scatter plots, heatmaps, and box plots to visualize key aspects such as airport traffic, airline distribution, and correlation patterns.

I also applied machine learning models to predict the 'fg_apt_id' variable, a crucial aspect of the dataset. I employed a combination of regression models including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Bagging Regressor, Support Vector Regressor, and Decision Tree Regressor. I evaluated the models' performance using techniques like cross-validation and the determination of the coefficient of determination (R-squared score).

Throughout the project, I emphasized clean coding practices and effective communication of results. This endeavor not only honed my skills in data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning but also showcased my ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets and present them coherently."
